<font color="black" size="+2">
    <b>Age-Related Issues:</b>
   
    Description: Different age groups have varying levels of access to technology. Younger generations (below thirty) are more likely to be fully connected and digitally literate, while older adults (over sixty-five) may lack access or choose not to use technology.
    Reasons: Lack of education about technology benefits and lifestyle situations that don’t necessitate connectivity.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Socioeconomic Factors:</b>
    Description: The digital divide mirrors income, education, and social standing disparities worldwide. People with higher income and education levels tend to have better access to technology and the internet.
    Reasons: Socioeconomic gaps contribute to unequal access, exacerbating overall inequalities.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Geographic Causes:</b>
    Description: Despite the internet’s omnipresence, some areas lack high-speed access. Urban cities and most suburbs enjoy better coverage, while rural regions often struggle to provide digital services to all residents.
    Reasons: Geographic limitations, accessibility issues, and financial constraints hinder equal access.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Racial, Cultural, and Language Factors:</b>
    Description: Disparities along racial, cultural, and language lines affect internet and technology access. Families primarily speaking non-English languages at home may find online resources less accessible.
    Reasons: Similar to wage gaps and disparities in education and healthcare, language barriers play a role.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Personal Choice:</b>
    Description: Some individuals simply choose not to engage with the internet. They may not recognize its benefits or prefer an alternative lifestyle.
    Reasons: While education about technology helps, respecting personal preferences is essential12.
